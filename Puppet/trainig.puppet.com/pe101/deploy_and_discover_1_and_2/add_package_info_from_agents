( Asta e ala dupa care ma doare capu' )

Got oto Node groups page, expand (click +) PE Infrastructure, and click the PE Agent 
On the Classes tab make sure you have class  puppet_enterprise::profile::agent with the following :
	package_inventory_enabled 	true
	pcp_broker_host			"puppet
	primary_uris			["puppet"]

Click run -> puppet , select the hosts, or leave it like that, click "run job" , the press "run again" -> "al nodees" 

Go to packages , and filter by package name , pres a package, and see which hosts have it ...
